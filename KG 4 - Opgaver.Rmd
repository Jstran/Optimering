# Finite Differencing

In the slides, Forward-Difference (`df.FD`) was compared to exact differentiation (`df.exact`) for

```{r}
f = function(x) cos(sin(x)*cos(x))
```

Reconstruct (implement) the example and the results in the slides yourself.

Include Central-Difference calculations in both trace and plots.
Remember to also add CD reference lines:

```{r}
abline(v = log10((eps^(1/3))), col = "blue")
abline(h = log10((eps^(2/3))), col = "blue")
```

Calculate the order ratio for CD and compare to that of FD.

```{r}

```

Try out Richardson Extrapolation for CD and compare to that of FD.

```{r}

```

What happens if we misuse the Richardson Extrapolation:

* For (incorrect) first-order correction for CD?
* For (incorrect) second-order correction for FD?
* Investigate for different choices of $h$.

```{r}

```
